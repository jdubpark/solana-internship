# nft-voter-v2: create a NFT powered govereance in spl-governance
`nft-voter` is a plugin designed to empower DAOs by leveraging NFTs and cNFTs within the spl-governance framework. This integration allows DAOs to manage and control their realms with an alternative way, providing both secure and a customizable governance model based on NFT ownership.

Note: This program is still under development and is not yet ready for production use.
Only support where the below configuration in MetadataArgs since Helius DAS API doesn't provide the three fields, so we fixed it now
```
uses: None,
token_program_version: TokenProgramVersion::Original,
token_standard: Some(TokenStandard::NonFungible),
```
